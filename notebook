VPC architecture:

1. All public

- Deploy your services in a public subnet
- Secure through Security Groups and ACLs

Pro:
- Simplicity
- Reduced cost

Con:
- As different images and services gets deployed, it gets harder to secure each one
- Increase the surface of attack

2. Bastion host

- Deploy a Bastion Host in a public subnet
- Allow SSH inbound traffic to the Bastion host
- Deploy a NAT Gateway
- Deploy your services in a private subnet (possibly using a VPC Endpoint instead of a NAT Gateway, when internet access not required, for reduced cost)
- Allow outbound traffic from your services through the NAT Gateway
- Allow inbound SSH from your Bastion Host's Security Group

Pro:
- You only have to worry about your Bastion Host's vulnerability (smaller attack surface)

Con:
- Cost (+Bastion's EC2, +NAT Gateway, +Auto Scaling Group for Bastion [possibly]...)
- Complexity (more infrastructure to maintain)
- It gets harder to access non-ssh resources such as databases

3. VPN
